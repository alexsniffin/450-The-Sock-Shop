<i>The Sock Shop</i> began in 1983 on the upscale Market Street in <b>Charleston, SC.</b><br /><br />
Most people stopped in just to see if we really sold socks.<br /><br />
Yes, we did.<br /><br />
Then, they usually found that we had socks that they wanted, so they purchased some.<br /><br />
They even bought socks as gifts.<br /><br />
The Sock Shop became a popular tourist destination.<br /><br />
With the advent of the Internet, our business grew.<br /><br />
We now operate out of North Charleston with shops in <b>Charleston, New York, San Francisco, and London</b>.
