* **About us**:

> The Sock Shop began in 1983 on the upscale Market Street in Charleston, SC.

> Most people stopped in just to see if we really sold socks.

> Yes, we did.

> Then, they usually found that we had socks that they wanted, so they purchased some.

> They even bought socks as gifts.

> The Sock Shop became a popular tourist destination.

> With the advent of the Internet, our business grew.

> We now operate out of North Charleston with shops in Charleston, New York, San Francisco, and London.


### Website design:

* **What are you favorite colors**: Blue and Black
* **What do you want in a website**:

> Many people ask "Why socks?"

> We want to sell socks. So we want to show socks.

> Our site will mainly be a product listing - we have hundreds of products we want to list.

> We'd like to put, say, three specials of the day on the main page and then a product listing of everything.
